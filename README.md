#RUBY RACER

Created by Nicholas Lee

Ruby Racer is a 2D platformer that makes use of random level generation to make every game completely unique.  The goal of the game is to manuever your character as to stay on the screen as long as possible and to generate the highest score.  The game begins with a board that slowly scrolls vertically, with the scrolling speed increasing every 10 seconds.  Once your character moves off the top of the screen the game is over.

There are mutliple ways to increase your score and multiple strategies for success!  First, the score increases continually as the game goes on, but it increases at a higher rate the lower the player is on the screen.  The second way to increase your score is to collect coins!  There are randomly generated coins that provide a substantial point bonus when they are collected.  There is also a point multiplier that causes coins to be worth more the longer you have been playing.

Got yourself in a jam and don't want to lose the game?  Use your bombs to blast your way through the floor!  The player starts the game with a single bomb in their inventory, but for every 5 coins collected, the player is awarded another bomb.
